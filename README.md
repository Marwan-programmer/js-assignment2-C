write a small web app that does the following (using a switch statement only):
    - asks the user to enter a string.
    - if the string is "red", the output should be "apple".
    - if the string is "yellow", the output should "banana".
    - if the string is "green", the output should be "grass".
    - if the string is "circle" or "rectangle" or "square", the output should be "shape".
    - if the string is anything else, the output should be "i don't know".
